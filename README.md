# weather-gui-sandbox
A sandbox Python project to learn about webframework and data visualization.

## Idea for version 0.1
* A webservice (spawned locally), where the user can choose a city in Denmark and get historical temperature data visualized.
* Application should feature
  * A configuration step for setting up API key to the [DMI weather data service](https://www.dmi.dk/friedata/klimadata)
  * A plot window where data can be shown
* Frameworks to be used could be: dash, matplotlib, numpy, pytest

### Possible extensions
* Supporting other sources of weather data
* Comparing temperature data between cities
* Prediction tab where the user can try to predict future weather trends using various (simple) machine learning models
* GUI Design (make it easily configurable for a new theme/design style)

## Requirements
TODO: Describe steps to install all necessary packages

## TODO
* Breaking down the application into tasks (cf. Github projects)
* Setting up a minimal starting point (MVP)
* Setting up a development environment
* Setting up unit testing
